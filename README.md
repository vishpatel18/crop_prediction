# crop_prediction
In this experiment we will be predicting the crops important conditions for it to have more denisty in its output.

The necessary conditions that are needed are nitrogen level, phosphorus level, potassium level, rainfall level, temperature level, and humidity level.
These factores affect the growth and production of the crops.

According to our analysis, for a specific crop, it needs a certain level of rainfall and ph level along with its k,p,n levels as well.
An accurate crop yield prediction model can help farmers to decide on what to grow and when to grow
According to our analysis, the most used features are temperature, rainfall, and soil type, and nitrogen phosphorus and potassium levels.

Libraries used:
-NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open source Python library that's used in almost every field of science and engineering. It's the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it's at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems
-Warning messages are displayed by warn() function defined in 'warning' module of Python's standard library. Warning is actually a subclass of Exception in built-in class hierarchy. There are a number of built-in Warning subclasses. User defined subclass can also be defined.
-Pandas is a Python library for data analysis. Started by Wes McKinney in 2008 out of a need for a powerful and flexible quantitative analysis tool, pandas has grown into one of the most popular Python libraries. It has an extremely active community of contributors.
-Matplotlib is a python library used to create 2D graphs and plots by using python scripts. It has a module named pyplot which makes things easy for plotting by providing feature to control line styles, font properties, formatting axes etc.
-OS is basically an entire operating system implemented as a library so user-space applications can directly use it to utilize system resources.

The scope of the project is to determine the crop yield of an area by considering dataset with some features which are important or related to crop production such as temperature, moisture, rainfall, and production of the crop in previous years. To predict a continuous value, regression models are used.

Crop yield prediction systems provide for better planning and decision-making to increase production. The proposed system involves a prediction module based on data mining classification algorithm namely Random Forest used to forecast the yield of major crops based on historical data
